# RBesT 1.8-2 - April 25th, 2025

## Enhancements

* Add experimental `write_mix_json` and `read_mix_json` functions
  which write and read mixture objects as JSON to/from files.
* Add `"msr"` parametrization to `mixmvnorm` which allows to consturct
  multi-variate normal mixtures in a parametrization using the mean
  vector, standard deviations and the correlations. This functionality
  is based on the new `msr2mvnorm` utility function.
* Allow standard deviations of 0 for components of a multi-variate
  normal mixture.

# RBesT 1.8-1 - January 20th, 2025

## Bugfixes

* Fixed an issue with the `ess` function for beta and gamma mixtures
  when used inside of `lapply` or `sapply`.

# RBesT 1.8-0 - January 8th, 2025

## Enhancements

* Enable ESS calculation for normal mixture densities when used in the
  context of a standard one-parameter exponential family through the
  new `family` argument. For example, this can be used to calculate
  the ESS of a normal mixture density representing a logit transformed
  response scale.
* Reformat R sources using `styler`.

## Bugfixes

* Correct boundary behavior of `BinaryExactCI` function whenever no
  responses or no non-responses are observed. Fixes issue #21.
* Stabilize internal beta mixture information function, which corrects
  unstable ESS ELIR computations. Addresses issue #22.

# RBesT 1.7-4 - November 21st, 2024

## Enhancements

* Added for `mixstanvar` automatic generation of distribution
  functions allowing truncated priors in `brms` with mixtures
* Slight speed increase for Stan model by more efficient construction
  of likelihood. Also reducing object size of `gMAP` objects by
  avoiding to store redundant variables.
* Upgraded `testthat` edition to version 3.

## Bugfixes

* Fix issue #18 of ESS ELIR aborting whenever one mixture component
  has zero weight.
* Fixed a rare issue when estimating ESS ELIR for beta mixtures. The
  calculation aborted due to boundary issues which are now avoided.
* Avoid over and underflow of beta-binomial distribution.
* Replace calls to deprecated `ggplot2::qplot` with respective calls
  to `ggplot2::ggplot`.
* Use new `array` notation for `mixstanvar` generated Stan code to
  make generated Stan programs compatible with Stan >= 2.33

# RBesT 1.7-3 - January 2nd, 2024

## Enhancements

* Updated Stan model file syntax to use new array syntax as required
  by Stan >=2.33. This upgrades the minimal Stan version to 2.26.
* Moved most vignettes to be articles to decrease size of R
  packages. Articles are available on [the package
  homepage](https://opensource.nibr.com/RBesT/articles/).

## Bugfixes

* Added `pngquant` to system requirements of package as requested by
  CRAN.

# RBesT 1.7-2 - August 21st, 2023

## Enhancements

* Add unit tests for `mixstanvar` function and disabled integration
  tests on CI/CD systems as these require significant resources due to
  the need to compile Stan models. The unit tests do ensure that
  things are correct from the `RBesT` side of things.
* Use new scheme of `roxygen2` to document package documentation.

## Bugfixes

* Make EM for normal and multivariate normal mixtures deterministic in
  that the resulting density does not depend on the random seed any
  longer, which is the intended behavior. Note that this change may
  cause that estimated normal / MVN mixtures will be numerically
  different as compared to the previous version. The estimated density
  itself is (statistically) still the very same.

# RBesT 1.7-1 - August 8th, 2023

## Enhancements

* Allow use of mixture priors in `brms` models with the new adapter
  function `mixstanvar`.
* Allow use of named dimensions for multivariate normal mixtures.
* Add *experimental* diagnostic plots for mixture multivariate normal
  EM fits. These are subject to changes in future release and user
  feedback is very welcome.
* Compress png plots of vignettes saving ~40% in file size of the
  package sources.

## Bugfixes

* Fix issue when plotting EM diagnostic debugging plots for normal
  mixtures.
* Comply with newer ggplot2 standards to not use `aes_string`.

# RBesT 1.7-0 - July 19th, 2023

## Enhancements

* Implementation multivariate normal mixture support in a first
  version. This includes density evaluation, basic summary functions
  and multivariate normal EM fitting. Support is not yet as complete
  as for other densites, but will be expanded in upcoming releases.
* Change the default for the option `constrain_gt1` of the EM for beta
  mixtures to `TRUE`. This will be default constrain the fitted
  parameters of each beta mixture component to be greater than unity
  as required for finite ESS elir calculations.

# RBesT 1.6-7 - June 26th, 2023

## Bug fixes

* resolve compilation from source issues on some platforms triggered
  by changes in `rstantools`
* correct documentation on difference distribution and improve PoS
  with co-data vignette

# RBesT 1.6-5 - February 8th, 2023

## Enhancements

  and the respective git commit hash used to create the sources of the
  package.

## Bug fixes

* ensure that `predict` for new studies will sample the study specifc
  random effect per iteration only once. This is important for MAP
  priors with covariate effects (which are pooled over the studies).

# RBesT 1.6-4 - August 5th, 2022

  Stan sampler had issues due to divergent transitions or non-convergence

  did not evaluate correctly, which was visible when plotting mixtures
  (with more than one component) with link functions

  to Ping Chen
* allow for constrained fitting of beta mixtures which have a & b
