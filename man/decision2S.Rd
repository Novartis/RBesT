\usage{
decision2S(
  pc = 0.975,
  qc = 0,
  lower.tail = TRUE,
  link = c("identity", "logit", "log")
)

oc2Sdecision(
  pc = 0.975,
  qc = 0,
  lower.tail = TRUE,
  link = c("identity", "logit", "log")

}
\arguments{
\item{pc}{Vector of critical cumulative probabilities of the
difference distribution.}

\item{qc}{Vector of respective critical values of the difference
distribution. Must match the length of \code{pc}.}

\item{lower.tail}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} (default), probabilities
are \eqn{P(X \leq x)}, otherwise, \eqn{P(X > x)}.}

\item{link}{Enables application of a link function prior to
evaluating the difference distribution. Can take one of the values
\code{identity} (default), \code{logit} or \code{log}.}
}
\value{
The function returns a decision function which takes three
arguments. The first and second argument are expected to be mixture
(posterior) distributions from which the difference distribution is
formed and all conditions are tested. The third argument determines
if the function acts as an indicator function or if the function
returns the distance from the decision boundary for each condition
in log-space. That is, the distance is 0 at the decision boundary,
negative for a 0 decision and positive for a 1 decision.
}
\description{
The function sets up a 2 sample one-sided decision function with an
arbitrary number of conditions on the difference distribution.
}
\details{
This function creates a one-sided decision function on the
basis of the difference distribution in a 2 sample situation. To
support double criterion designs, see \emph{Neuenschwander et al.,
2010}, an arbitrary number of criterions can be given. The decision
function demands that the probability mass below the critical value
\code{qc} of the difference \eqn{\theta_1 - \theta_2} is at least
\code{pc}. Hence, for \code{lower.tail=TRUE} condition \eqn{i} is
equivalent to

\deqn{P(\theta_1 - \theta_2 \leq q_{c,i}) > p_{c,i}}

and the decision function is implemented as indicator function
using the heavy-side step function \eqn{H(x)} which is \eqn{0} for
\eqn{x \leq 0} and \eqn{1} for \eqn{x > 0}. As all conditions must
be met, the final indicator function returns

\deqn{\Pi_i H_i(P(\theta_1 - \theta_2 \leq q_{c,i}) - p_{c,i} ),}

which is \eqn{1} if all conditions are met and \eqn{0}
otherwise. For \code{lower.tail=FALSE} differences must be greater
than the given quantiles \code{qc}.

Note that whenever a \code{link} other than \code{identity} is
requested, then the underlying densities are first transformed
using the link function and then the probabilties for the
differences are calculated in the transformed space. Hence, for a
binary endpoint the default \code{identity} link will calculate
risk differences, the \code{logit} link will lead to decisions
based on the differences in \code{logit}s corresponding to a
criterion based on the log-odds. The \code{log} link will evaluate
ratios instead of absolute differences which could be useful for a
binary endpoint or counting rates. The respective critical
quantiles \code{qc} must be given on the transformed scale.
